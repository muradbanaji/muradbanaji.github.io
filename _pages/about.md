I completed my PhD in mathematics in 2001 from Queen Mary, University of London. Since then, I have worked at UCL, the University of Essex, the University of Portsmouth, and Middlesex University in roles including research fellow, teaching fellow, lecturer, senior lecturer and reader - not necessarily in this order! I currently hold a visiting position at Middlesex University London. My main area of expertise is in dynamical systems, with a focus on applications in biology, medicine and chemistry. Broadly I am interested in questions of how network structure determines allowed dynamical behaviours in dynamical systems.

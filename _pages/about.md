I completed my PhD in mathematics in 2001 from Queen Mary, University of London. Since then, I have worked at UCL, the University of Essex, the University of Portsmouth, Middlesex University, and the University of Oxford, in roles including research fellow, teaching fellow, lecturer, senior lecturer and reader - but not in that order! I am currently a departmental lecturer at the University of Oxford.

Much of my research is in dynamical systems, with a focus on applications in biology, medicine and chemistry. Broadly I am interested in questions of how network structure determines allowed dynamical behaviours in dynamical systems.

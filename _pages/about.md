I am a mathematician. I completed my PhD in mathematics in 2001 from Queen Mary, University of London. Since then, I have worked at UCL, the University of Essex, the University of Portsmouth, and Middlesex University. My main area of expertise is in dynamical systems, with a specific focus on applications in biology, medicine and chemistry.

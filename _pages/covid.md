* [Mortality and Death Registration in India](https://www.theindiaforum.in/article/mortality-and-death-registration-india) (with A. Gupta and V. Paikra), **The India Forum** (August 2022).

* [Estimates of pandemic excess mortality in India based on civil registration data](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgph.0000803) (with Aashish Gupta), **PLoS Global Public Health** (2022). We use death registration data from twelve states comprising around 60% of the national population to estimate the scale of the pandemic mortality surge in India.

* [The bitter dispute over India's pandemic mortality](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/the-bitter-dispute-over-indias-pandemic-mortality/article65405332.ece?homepage=true) (with Aashish Gupta, in The Hindu, 12/05/22). After publication of the WHO's estimates of India's pandemic mortality, government rebuttals got more strident. These rebuttals include wild claims about civil registration coverage which do not stand up to scrutiny. (The article is paywalled, but an image is available [here](https://maths.mdx.ac.uk/research/modelling-the-covid-19-pandemic/thehinduwhomortality/).)

* [Making Sense of Covid-19 Mortality Estimates for India](https://www.theindiaforum.in/article/covid-mortality-india) (The India Forum, 05/05/22). What is the basis for Indian government objections to estimates of pandemic mortality in India? And do these objections hold water? A detailed review of the literature and the government responses. This piece is also in a more abbreviated form [here](https://science.thewire.in/health/who-report-health-ministry-covid-deaths-data-dispute/).


* [Estimating potential excess mortality during the third (Omicron) wave of India's COVID-19 epidemic](https://maths.mdx.ac.uk/research/modelling-the-covid-19-pandemic/wave3mortalitynotes/) (Technical document, 24/01/22). A first attempt to estimate what the mortality impact of the wave might be, based on previous waves and international data.

* [Why the IIT Kanpur Report on UP’s COVID-19 Crisis Was Dishonest](https://science.thewire.in/health/iit-kanpur-report-manindra-agrawal-uttar-pradesh-covid19-mortality/) (The Wire, 20/10/21). Some highly dubious and unscientific work on the pandemic and its handling. This piece is focussed on the questions the IIT report failed to ask about mortality.

* [Many say Covid-19 will transition 'from epidemic to endemic'. But what does this mean?](https://scroll.in/pulse/1007845/many-say-covid-19-will-transition-from-epidemic-to-endemic-but-what-does-this-mean) (Scroll, 19/10/21).

* [With COVID-19, India Experienced Its Greatest Mortality Crisis Since Independence](https://science.thewire.in/health/india-covid-19-excess-deaths-analysis-official-data-crs/) (With Aashish Gupta, The Wire, 05/10/2021). Summary of the key points in our [preprint](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.30.21264376v1) on pandemic excess mortality in India. Contextualising the numbers and seeing how they align with the progress of the epidemic. 


* [Covid-19: What data about excess deaths reveals about Mumbai's class divide](https://scroll.in/article/1005383/covid-19-what-data-about-excess-deaths-reveals-about-mumbais-class-divide) (Scroll, 15/09/2021). All-cause mortality data indicates that the bulk of Mumbai's uncounted deaths were probably amongst slum-dwellers. It tells a story, probably repeated across the country, of how official data risks understating the toll of the pandemic on marginalised communities. Based on the updated [preprint on medrxiv here](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.08.21255101v2).

* [Estimating COVID-19 infection fatality rate in Mumbai during 2020](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.08.21255101v2) (09/09/2021). Preprint on medrxiv updated to take into consideration extra insights from monthly all causes mortality data.

Article behind a paywall, but image available [here](https://maths.mdx.ac.uk/research/modelling-the-covid-19-pandemic/acmthehinduimage/).) Some estimates on excess mortality in India during the pandemic. We discuss the issues with death registration data, why making excess mortality estimates is complicated, and why the numbers are likely to rise. Based on a technical document: [Estimates of pandemic excess mortality in India based on civil registration data](https://www.indiacovidmapping.org/reports/mortality/NationalAllCauseMortalityEstimates.pdf).

* [Survey evidence of excess mortality in Bihar in the second COVID-19 surge](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zxq97/). (30/07/2021, preprint, with Apurva Bamezai, Aashish Gupta, Shivani Pandey, Sharan MR, Kanika Sharma and Chanchal Kumar Singh). A small survey in Bihar found a huge surge in mortality during the second COVID-19 wave: around four times normal (95% CI: 2.2x to 6.4x normal).

* [COVID-19 in Kerala: Is the Story Very Different From the Rest of the Country?](https://science.thewire.in/health/covid-19-in-kerala-is-the-story-very-different-from-the-rest-of-the-country/) (The Wire, 22/07/2021). Kerala has managed and surveilled its epidemic better than many states in the country. Mortality is lower than some states, but still significant.

* [What does mortality data tell us about Bihar's first Covid-19 wave?](https://scroll.in/article/999865/what-does-mortality-data-tell-us-about-bihars-first-covid-19-wave) (Scroll, 11/07/2021). Bihar's all cause mortality data reveals just how badly it was hit in the first COVID-19 wave.

* [Making Sense of Madhya Pradesh's Shocking Deaths Increase in April and May](https://science.thewire.in/health/making-sense-of-madhya-pradeshs-shocking-deaths-increase-in-april-and-may/) (The Wire, 14/06/2021). An analysis of the alarming all-cause mortality surge in Madhya Pradesh. In a single month there were five times as many deaths as normal.

* [What local news reports tell us about Covid-19 mortality in rural areas of North and Central India](https://scroll.in/article/997104/what-local-news-reports-tell-us-about-covid-19-mortality-in-rural-areas-of-north-and-central-india) (with Leena Kumarappan and Aashish Gupta, Scroll, 10/06/21). A study of COVID-19 mortality in 61 villages or clusters, based on newspaper reports. Rapid surges, and high median excess mortality (0.29%).

* [Mumbai's COVID Situation Is Improving – but Is the City Safe From More Surges?](https://science.thewire.in/health/mumbais-covid-situation-is-improving-but-is-the-city-safe-from-more-surges/) (The Wire, 26 May, 2021). A summary of what we know and don't know about variants, how many were infected during the latest surge, and why it wound down. Includes some speculation about the role of prior infections and vaccination in mortality trends.

* [Scientific uncertainties, weak institutions, and nationalism led to COVID-19 devastation](https://caravanmagazine.in/health/scientific-uncertainties-wea-institutions-and-nationalis-led-to-covid19-devastation) (The Caravan, 14/05/2021). An attempt to understand how scientific narratives and political considerations got entangled, leading to the complacency which preceded India's devastating second COVID-19 wave. 

* [Estimating COVID-19 fatalities in India](https://www.theindiaforum.in/article/estimating-covid-19-fatalities-india) (The India Forum, 10/05/2021). Why it's hard, why it's important, and how we can try: a detailed overview. 

* [Bengaluru is reaching a Covid-19 crisis point. How did it get there?](https://scroll.in/article/994283/bengaluru-is-reaching-a-covid-19-crisis-point-how-did-it-get-there) (Scroll, 07/05/2021). How did the city get to a point where it had the highest active case-load of any Indian city at any point in the pandemic?

* [Are COVID-19 Vaccines Saving Lives in Mumbai? Here's the Math](https://www.thequint.com/voices/opinion/covid-19-pandemic-mumbai-trends-deaths-cases-numbers-senior-citizens-young-population-vaccination-efficacy) (The Quint, 26/04/2021). Although the kind of data needed to conclusively demonstrate a vaccine effect is missing, the city's fatality rates and age-distribution of COVID deaths give strong hints that vaccination is saving lives. The scale and timing of the effect match what we would expect in terms of strong protection against severe disease a few weeks after first dose vaccination.

* [What could be driving Delhi's devastating fourth Covid-19 surge?](https://scroll.in/article/992972/what-could-be-driving-delhis-devastating-fourth-covid-19-surge) (Scroll, 22/04/2021). Why is disease spreading so fast in the national capital, and why are deaths so high?

* [What could be driving Mumbai's surge?](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/what-could-be-driving-mumbais-covid-surge/article34192746.ece) (The Hindu, 30/03/2021, Article behind a paywall, but image available [here](https://maths.mdx.ac.uk/research/modelling-the-covid-19-pandemic/mumbaithehindu/).) Trying to make sense of the brutal new surge in already-hard-hit Mumbai. What role could uneven spread in earlier waves, and new variants be playing?

* [Has a More Deadly Novel Coronavirus Variant Increased Fatalities in Punjab?](https://science.thewire.in/health/has-a-more-deadly-novel-coronavirus-variant-increased-fatalities-in-punjab/) (The Wire, 27/03/2021). The variant B.1.1.7 (first found in the UK) has reportedly become widespread in Punjab. And we can see the effects of B.1.1.7's greater lethality if we carefully track cases and fatalities in the state. 

* [As Mumbai battles its third Covid-19 surge, could vaccination stop the wave?](https://scroll.in/article/989626/as-mumbai-battles-its-third-covid-19-surge-could-vaccination-stop-the-wave) (Scroll, 16/03/2021). How bad could Mumbai's third surge be, and what could bring it under control?

* [How the Economic Survey Used Dubious Analysis to Spin India’s COVID Response](https://science.thewire.in/health/how-the-economic-survey-used-dubious-analysis-to-spin-indias-covid-response/) (The Wire, 08/03/2021). Incomplete data and flawed analysis were used to create narratives about India's COVID-19 epidemic and response which had little substance.

* [India’s Dwindling COVID-19 Cases – Sign of Effective Control or Increasing Immunity?](https://science.thewire.in/the-sciences/are-indias-dwindling-covid-19-cases-a-sign-of-effective-control-or-increasing-immunity/) (The Wire, 20/02/2021). An attempt to unravel what lies behind the wind-down in cases and deaths nationally, and go beyond some of the simple narratives in the media and social media.

* [What lessons do India’s Covid-19 serosurveys hold?](https://scroll.in/article/986097/what-lessons-do-indias-covid-19-serosurveys-hold) (Scroll, 06/02/2021). India's serosurveys give us vital clues about the Indian COVID-19 epidemic. But sometimes they tell us less about the disease and more about the interaction between science, media and politics.

* [COVID-19: What the Third National Sero-Survey Result Does and Doesn’t Tell Us](https://science.thewire.in/health/third-national-seroprevalence-survey-icmr-covid-19-rural-prevalence-test-positivity/) (The Wire, 05/02/2021). The survey indicates that India is unlikely to be near herd immunity, and that disease has moved increasingly to rural areas where detection is poorer.

* [COVID-19 in India: Where Is It at and What Does the Future Have in Store?](https://science.thewire.in/health/covid-19-india-local-epidemics-surveillance-data-transmission-sitrep/) (The Wire, 06/12/20). What has driven the national slowdown in cases and deaths, will there be another surge?

* [Why is Covid-19 surging in Delhi eight months after the pandemic started?](https://scroll.in/article/978548/why-is-covid-19-surging-in-delhi-eight-months-after-the-pandemic-started) (Scroll, 15/11/20). 
I used some Monte Carlo simulation to try to understand the origins of the third wave in Delhi, and to estimate levels of infection, detection changing fatality rate, and so forth. The technical version is [here](http://maths.mdx.ac.uk/research/modelling-the-covid-19-pandemic/delhiwaningantibodiesnotes/).

* Two pieces on Bihar's COVID-19 epidemic: [Bihar’s COVID-19 Epidemic Is Not Over – but Where Is It, Exactly?](https://science.thewire.in/health/bihar-covid-19-epidemic-cases-rapid-antigen-tests-positivity-death-surveillance-urbanisation-elections/) (The Wire, 27/10/2020)

Technical notes for the first piece [here](http://maths.mdx.ac.uk/research/modelling-the-covid-19-pandemic/biharcovidarticlenotes/).

* [Herd Immunity for COVID-19 – a Straightforward Explainer](https://science.thewire.in/health/india-covid-19-epidemic-herd-immunity-threshold-lockdown-vaccine-mitigation/) (The Wire, 11/10/20). What is herd immunity all about, and what is a 'herd immunity approach' to COVID-19? And is it a good idea? In Q and A form.

* [What Early Reports From Mumbai’s Second Seroprevalence Survey Tell Us](https://science.thewire.in/health/mumbai-second-seroprevalence-survey-results-waning-sensitivity/) (The Wire, 06/10/20). 
A smaller fraction of people were found with COVID-19 antibodies compared to the last survey (early July). Was this good news, bad news - or about waning antibodies? ([Accompanying calculations](http://maths.mdx.ac.uk/research/modelling-the-covid-19-pandemic/mumbaisecondserosurveyfull/) on the effects of waning test sensitivity.)

* [What Is Driving Mumbai's COVID-19 Surge? And How Bad Is It?](https://science.thewire.in/health/mumbai-covid-19-cases-surge-rains-containment-zones-slum-areas-access-to-testing/) (The Wire, 28/09/20). 
Despite high COVID-19 prevalence Mumbai saw a surge in cases in September recording its highest daily figures of the epidemic so far. What drove this surge? ([Accompanying technical material](http://maths.mdx.ac.uk/research/modelling-the-covid-19-pandemic/mumbairesurgencesuppl/) focussed on different levels of infection detection in slum and non-slum areas of Mumbai.)

* [Covid-19: Why it's impossible to draw firm conclusions from the first national serosurvey](https://scroll.in/article/973812/the-first-national-covid-19-serosurvey-has-too-many-errors-and-omissions-to-draw-firm-conclusions) (Scroll, 23/09/20). 
The first national serosurvey in India was riddled with flaws, and yet implausible narratives built on its tenuous data abound. ([A detailed peer review](http://maths.mdx.ac.uk/research/modelling-the-covid-19-pandemic/icmrsurveynotes/) of the first serosurvey paper in IJMR.)

* [Mumbai Had 13k ‘Excess’ Deaths in March-July. How Does Its COVID Story Change?](https://science.thewire.in/the-sciences/covid-19-mumbai-all-cause-mortality-data-ifr-bmc-seroprevalence-survey/) (The Wire, 10/09/20). 
The Indian Express obtained all cause mortality data for Mumbai which showed a sharp rise in excess deaths during March-July over and above the recorded COVID-19 deaths. The city's COVID story is gradually becoming clearer. (A more fully linked version of this piece with technical detail [here](http://maths.mdx.ac.uk/research/modelling-the-covid-19-pandemic/mumbaicovidstorypart2full/).)

* [Are Health Experts Right To Focus on Cutting COVID-19 Deaths, Not Containment?](https://science.thewire.in/health/expert-groups-joint-statement-covid-19-deaths-containment-critique/) (The Wire, 03/09/20). Some thoughts on recommendations by public health bodies that “the government’s focus should be to prevent deaths from COVID-19 and no longer on containing the infection.”

* [A city divided: Covid-19 reveals Mumbai’s faultlines](https://scroll.in/article/970840/a-city-divided-covid-19-reveals-mumbai-s-faultlines) (Scroll, 20/08/20). 
Mumbai's COVID-19 story is only gradually starting to become clear. With rapid spread in the slums, and a more long drawn out epidemic in middle class areas, Mumbai has seen two interlinked epidemics; housing poverty is the key dividing line. A fully referenced version of this piece [here](http://maths.mdx.ac.uk/research/modelling-the-covid-19-pandemic/mumbais-covid-19-story-so-far/).

* [COVID-19: Has Delhi Passed its Peak or Is its Test Strategy Confusing the Picture?](https://thewire.in/health/covid-19-delhi-peak-testing) (The Wire, 22/07/2020). Delhi ramped up COVID-19 testing, and then gradually switched from sensitive RT-PCR tests, to less sensitive rapid antigen tests. This created a sharp peak and rapid descent in daily case data which hid a more ambiguous reality.

* [How many people in India have had Covid-19?](https://scroll.in/article/966898/how-many-people-in-india-have-had-covid-19) (Scroll, 09/07/2020).

* [Why case fatality rate itself is almost never the story – but is often made to be](https://science.thewire.in/health/covid-19-india-case-fatality-rate-confusion-propaganda/). (The Wire, 27/06/2020). Case fatality rate (CFR) is perhaps the most misused of all statistics in discussions about COVID-19. A quick summary of what CFR does not tell us, how CFR is misused, and how CFR could still provide some useful hints about the trajectory of COVID-19 if analysed carefully.

* [Maharashtra's missing COVID-19 deaths: an update](https://science.thewire.in/health/maharashtra-missing-covid-19-fatalities-reconciliation/).
